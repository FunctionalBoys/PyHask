* PyHask
PyHask is the project for compiler's design class, it aims to build
a small object oriented programming language using Haskell with syntax inspired on Python.

** Language's philosophy
This language aims to be an imperative styled and statically typed language with support for the basic control flow structures,
declaration for primitive types, declaration of N-dimensional arrays (PyHask does not impose a limit on the number of dimensions for an array), primitive based functions and basic objected oriented functionality. PyHask believes
in scopes with arbitraty depth and to allow variables declared in a scope to be redeclared outside of it.

PyHask borrows most of its syntax from Python, including type annotations for which it borrows Python's type hints.
The project aims for the feel of an scripting language by not imposing the creation of a main block, and to
freely allow variable declarations anywhere in the code.
